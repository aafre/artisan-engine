# Artisan Engine

The mission of Artisan is to provide a production-grade, OpenAI-compatible API layer for local Large Language Models. It enables developers to build sophisticated, secure, and stateful applications with the same ease and elegance as proprietary cloud services.
This repository currently contains a Proof of Concept (POC) to validate the core technology.
